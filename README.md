# macos-activate-app

## Usage

Install which provides the `macos-app-switcher-by-pid` binary:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Then run like this:

```bash
macos-app-switcher-by-pid <pid>
```

## Motivation

I was using `hs.window.find("Kotlin Emacs"):focus()` with Hammerspoon, but it has a severe performance impact, should any application hang up since Hammerspoon queries all windows and on stuck applications, this can take seconds. If no windows are stuck, it is fast, but this Rust code is usually faster.

## Benchmarks

On MacBook Pro M1 2020.

### This repo

```bash
$ hyperfine 'target/release/macos-app-switcher-by-pid 37529'

Benchmark 1: target/release/macos-app-switcher-by-pid 37529
  Time (mean ± σ):      39.7 ms ±  10.6 ms    [User: 4.0 ms, System: 3.1 ms]
  Range (min … max):    35.6 ms …  96.0 ms    40 runs
 
  Warning: The first benchmarking run for this command was significantly slower than the rest (71.2 ms). This could be caused by (filesystem) caches that were not filled until after the first run. You should consider using the '--warmup' option to fill those caches before the actual benchmark. Alternatively, use the '--prepare' option to clear the caches before each timing run.
```

### Hammerspoon in CLI via `hs`

```bash
$ hyperfine "hs -c 'hs.window.find(\"Kotlin Emacs\"):focus()'"

Benchmark 1: hs -c 'hs.window.find("Kotlin Emacs"):focus()'
  Time (mean ± σ):      89.6 ms ±  13.0 ms    [User: 8.6 ms, System: 8.6 ms]
  Range (min … max):    74.4 ms … 122.6 ms    23 runs
```

### Interpreted Osascript

```bash
$ hyperfine 'osascript -e "tell application \"System Events\"
                                                 set proc to first process whose unix id is 37529
                                                 set frontmost of proc to true
                                                 end tell"'
                                                 
Benchmark 1: osascript -e "tell application \"System Events\"
       set proc to first process whose unix id is 37529
       set frontmost of proc to true
   end tell"
  Time (mean ± σ):     188.7 ms ±  24.2 ms    [User: 23.4 ms, System: 19.3 ms]
  Range (min … max):   150.9 ms … 223.1 ms    13 runs
```
